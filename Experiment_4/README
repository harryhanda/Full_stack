# Travel Bucket List — Experiment 4

## Project Overview

This project is an enhanced version of the Travel Bucket List web application built using React.
In Experiment 4, the application architecture was upgraded to implement advanced React concepts such as global state management, structured reducers, performance optimization, and proper multi-page routing.

The UI design from Experiment 3 has been preserved while improving the internal code structure and scalability.

## Experiment 4 Enhancements

The following improvements were implemented:

* Integrated React Router for proper multi-page navigation
* Implemented Context API (useContext) for global state management
* Added useReducer for structured wishlist state updates
* Used useMemo for optimizing derived computations
* Created a new Analytics page demonstrating reducer and memo usage
* Maintained consistent and responsive UI design
* Improved overall project scalability and maintainability

## Key Features

* Multi-page navigation (Home, Explore, Wishlist, Analytics)
* Global Wishlist management
* Optimized calculations using useMemo
* Modern responsive UI with Material UI and Bootstrap
* Centralized state using Context and Reducer
